Here goes my (actually second) introduction. In the spirit of never translating my posts word by word, this one begins a lot differently. Anyways, I wanted a blog. If you want a blog, feel free to do one; this is mine. Wouldn't mind incorporating other authors' contributions though, in a dictatorial manner nonetheless.

Soo uhm, anyways, it's gonna have a disclaimer page telling you to be gentle with my mistakes. Also, feel free to correct my spelling by making a pull request at `this blog's repo <https:///github.com/NotBru/not_my_blog>`_, and feel free to contact me about any issue you have with the content I upload.

I'm gonna write about lotsa fun stuff, hopefully music, but also science and, why not, my own inner pain. If I'm successful enough I may get your neurons to twist a bit, make you see or consider an approach you haven't before.

About me? I'm Bru. My pronnouns are whichever you like, with a prefference to “they/them”. You should feel free to call me however you like, I'll speak with you if it's pleasant. The name of the blog is a *portmantieu* between *mind* and *wilderness*, but you can also think of it as a variation of *mindedness* (wink wink).

Until next time, sib.
