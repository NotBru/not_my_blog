    <p>When I write, speak, think, or communicate through <a class="reference external" href="https://half-life.fandom.com/wiki/Vortigaunt">vortessence</a>, I take a lot of understandings for granted, without which a proper interpretation of what I say will become pretty hard. At worse, the person reading my blog jumps straight away to a literal interpretation of my words. This blog <strong>is not for them</strong>. If you're the other kind of person, and find yourself wondering “Is this dude really this much of a jerk”, well, with a bit of luck this list will let you figure out whether it's a yes or a no.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>I don't like lawyer-writting. That is, I make little effort to be specific with my language. Although I often choose and use specific words, in contrast with their similar alternatives, I'll oftentimes choose wrongly. Better doubt, than jump to conclusions, right? :)</li>
<li>I make mistakes. A lot of them. I'm gonna try to have a higher standard about what I write here, but I'm still gonna embarrass myself with the mistakes that slip through. Read me gently.</li>
<li>I believe ideas are worth on their own. If I'm exposing an idea, there's no guarantee that I were, am, or will be, in agreement with it. Think about it by itself to choose whether you find it reasonable.</li>
<li>This list is most probably incomplete. It's gonna be expanded with the passage of time.</li>
